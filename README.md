## README for Repo OSProjects 

(Jim's Open Source Projects)

Convention: Place the GitHub repo one directory down, allowing the parent directory
to contain notes and test cases that won't clutter the GitHub repo for the open source project.

==> When adding a new open source GitHub repo, add the OS repo to this repo's .gitignore.
